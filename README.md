# Even in C Sharp

## What is this about ?

This is a very basic coding test.

You have:

- an implementation Tester class file where you must fill the blanks methods (`Tester.cs`)
- a unit test file that tells you what is the expected behavior and what cases are tested (`UnitTest1.cs`)

The goal is of course to make all unit tests pass!

## How code and run the tests

If you are a C# developer, you should find out quickly how to run the tests; they are initially written using Visual Studio 2015.

Just in case:

- open the solution `EVentInCSharp.sln`; and run tests from the `UnitTest1.cs` file.

## Rules and expected result

The goal is to have all unit tests passing.

- Time: this is not a race, but it is expected that implementation should not take more than 1 hour.
- Implementation: of course, having a rather clean implementation does matter and DRY.
